====== Verb forms in various languages and in DZ Interset ======

This is not a complete list of verbal tenses found in all languages. It focuses on tenses that are expressed synthetically, i.e. using affixes in one word (as opposed to analytical expression, using combination of a main verb and an auxiliary verb). Morphological / part-of-speech tags usually only need to distinguish synthetical verb forms.

  * finite verb
    * indicative

| English | modal verb, main verb; base form (infinitive but without "to"), gerund/present participle, past participle, non 3rd person singular present, 3rd person singular present |
| German | auxiliary verb, modal verb, main verb; finite (indicative), imperative, infinitive, infinitive with "zu", perfect participle |
| Portuguese | infinitive, indicative, imperative, subjunctive, conditional, present, past, pluperfect |
| Swedish | indicative, imperative, subjunctive, infinitive; present, past, supine; active, passive |


===== Infinitive =====

Usually considered base form of the verb, appears in dictionaries. In text it appears as part of analytical verb forms and as argument of other words:
  * future tense: //bude dělat//, //er wird kommen//
  * argument of modal verb: //musí dělat//, //er muss machen//, //he must do//
  * argument of some other verbs, subordinating conjunctions etc.: //potřebuje odejít//, //er kommt um das zu beenden//, //he let us to do it//, //his intention to finish this//

In some languages infinitive is marked by verb affixes:
  * Czech infinitive ends in //-t, -ti, -ct, -ci: dělat, dělati, říct, říci//
  * German infinitive ends in //-en: machen, sagen//
In some languages, the morpheme marking infinitive is separate word (English //to//). In English, the base form of the verb is not (full) infinitive. It becomes infinitive when combined with the infinitive mark (//to do, to say//). Without the mark, it can be used (in English) as imperative.

Both approaches can be combined. Although infinitives are recognizable by the //-en// suffix in German, the infinitive mark //zu// is used with infinitives in some contexts. Depending on the verb, //zu// is either a separate word, or a morpheme inserted between the verb prefix and stem (//zu beenden// vs. //anzupassen//).
  * English infinitive mark is //to//
  * German infinitive mark is //zu//
  * Danish infinitive mark is //at//
  * Swedish infinitive mark is //att//

In DZ Interset, infinitive is decoded as ''verbform = inf''. This value is set even for the English base verb form, although it is not certain whether the form is used as infinitive, or imperative. Mood, tense and voice are usually empty. Czech infinitives set the feature ''negativeness''. Portuguese infinitives can be mildly conjugated. I think I may have seen active/passive infinitives but I am not sure where. [in Encyklopedický slovník češtiny p.180? //být psán, být bit//]

===== Finite =====

Finite verb forms are those most frequently used. They are classified according to ''mood'': the most ordinary mood is **indicative**, most languages also have **imperative**, some also have **subjunctive** and **jussive**.

Opposed to finite verbs are non-finite verb forms, namely infinitive, supine, participle, transgressive and gerund.

In DZ Interset, finite verb form is decoded as ''verbform = fin''.

===== Indicative =====

Verbs in indicative mood merely indicate that someone performs / has performed / will perform the action of the verb. Opposed to indicative is imperative (the verb orders the listener to perform the action) and various conditional constructions (the action would be performed if...)

There is a multitude of indicative verb forms, classified according to tense (**present**, **past**, **future** etc.) and voice (**active** or **passive**). Present active forms are the default. They are usually the simplest, formed synthetically. Other tenses and voices are formed synthetically or analytically, depending on language.

In DZ Interset, indicative is decoded as ''mood = ind''. This is also the default mood value for finite verb forms. (For non-finite verb forms, default mood is empty.)

===== Present =====

Verbs in present tense indicate an action that is taking place at the time of speaking, or in a general timespan ("usually"). They are usually formed synthetically, and take different forms according to ''person'' and ''number'', possibly also ''gender''. If two verbs use different morphemes to express the same combination of person, number, gender etc., they are assigned to different **conjugation classes.** Example: Czech verb //nést//:

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural|
| 1st | //nesu// | //neseme// |
| 2nd | //neseš// | //nesete// |
| 3rd | //nese// | //nesou// |

In DZ Interset, present tense is decoded as ''tense = pres''.

Czech verbs are divided lexically to **perfective** and **imperfective.** Present tense forms of perfective verbs are in fact forms of **future** tense. If the physical tagset encodes these forms as present, they will be decoded into Interset as ''tense = pres''. However, if the physical tagset contains the information that these are semantically future forms, it will be decoded as ''tense = fut''.

The English **progressive present** tense (//he is doing//) is formed analytically by the simple present form of the auxiliary verb //to be// and the **present participle (gerund)** of the main verb. There is thus no Interset feature value for this tense. See participle and gerund.

===== Past =====

Simple past indicates action that took place in past. Some languages (e.g. Czech) have only this one past tense. Others have more refined tense system that allow to express whether the action has been completed (**perfect**) or not (**imperfect**), whether it was running while something else was being done etc. In Czech however, the perfect/imperfect aspect is lexically inherent, so that past perfect is replaced by simple past tense of a perfective verb.

Czech past tense is formed by **past participle** of the main verb and (in 1st and 2nd person only) present form of the auxiliary verb //být//. The participle is decoded with ''tense = past''. (The Czech past tense is a **preterite** by usage, although its creation bears charactersitics of a **perfect,** from which it has historically evolved.)

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural|
| 1st | //nesl jsem// | //nesli jsme// |
| 2nd | //nesl jsi// | //nesli jste// |
| 3rd | //nesl// | //nesli// |

German imperfect past tense //(Präteritum)// is formed synthetically. Perfect past tense //(Perfekt)// is formed analytically by present form of the auxiliary verb //haben// and past participle of the main verb. Pluperfect past tense //(Plusquamperfekt)// is formed analytically by imperfect past form of the auxiliary verb //haben// or //sein// and past participle of the main verb. The imperfect past forms and the participle are decoded with ''tense = past''.

| Person | Imperfect | | Perfect | | Pluperfect |
| | Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //ich machte// | //wir machten// | //ich habe gemacht// | //wir haben gemacht// | //ich hatte gemacht// | //wir hatten gemacht// |
| 2nd | //du machtest// | //ihr machtet// | //du hast gemacht// | //ihr habt gemacht// | //du hattest gemacht// | //ihr hattet gemacht// |
| 3rd | //er machte// | //sie machten// | //er hat gemacht// | //sie haben gemacht// | //er hatte gemacht// | //sie hatten gemacht// |

The same holds for English:

| Person | Imperfect | | Perfect | | Pluperfect |
| | Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //I did// | //we did// | //I have done// | //we have done// | //I had done// | //we had done// |
| 2nd | //you did// | //you did// | //you have done// | //you have done// | //you had done// | //you had done// |
| 3rd | //he did// | //they did// | //he has done// | //they have done// | //he had done// | //they had done// |

In Portuguese, three of five past tenses are synthetic and two are analytic. All three are decoded as ''tense = past''. They have to be further distinguished by the values of subtense. //Imperfeito// (imperfect) is decoded as ''subtense = imp''. //Pretérito// (preterite) is decoded as ??? //Mais-que-perfeito// (pluperfect) is decoded as ''subtense = pqp''. Analytic tenses are //perfeito// (perfect), //tenho caçado//, auxiliary in present and past participle, and another form of //mais-que-perfeito// (pluperfect), //tinha caçado//, auxiliary in imperfect and past participle.

| Person | Pretérito | | Imperfeito | | Mais-que-perfeito |
| | Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //cacei// | //caçámos// | //caçava// | //caçávamos// | //caçara// | //caçáramos// |
| 2nd | //caçaste// | | //caçavas// | | //caçaras// | |
| 3rd | //caçou// | //caçaram// | //caçava// | //caçavam// | //caçara// | //caçaram// |

===== Preterite =====

This is the default past tense. Grammars of some languages call it just "past" or "simple past". Portuguese calls it //pretérito// while Spanish calls it //pretérito perfecto simple// (Czech //minulý čas dokonavý//), as opposed to //pretérito perfecto compuesto,// which is parallel to what we call perfect here, see below. Often synthetic. Simply indicates an action that took place in past. No information whether the action has been completed or whether it ran simultaneously with another action.

German example: //Präteritum// of //singen// (to sing):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural|
| 1st | //ich sang// | //wir sangen// |
| 2nd | //du sangst// | //ihr sangt// |
| 3rd | //er sang// | //sie sangen// |

English example: //past tense// of //to sing//:

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //I sang// | //we sang// |
| 2nd | //you sang// | //you sang// |
| 3rd | //he sang// | //they sang// |

Portuguese example: //pretérito// of //caçar//:

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //cacei// | //caçámos// |
| 2nd | //caçaste// | |
| 3rd | //caçou// | //caçaram// |

DZ Interset decoding: ''tense = "past"; subtense = "";''

===== Aorist =====

The simple, aspect-neutral past tense is called //aorist// in some languages, e.g. in Bulgarian. So far I have not come across differences between aorist and preterite, nor have I found a tagset/language where both these tenses would co-exist. The German preterite, for instance, displays usage pattern typical to aorist, although it is not called aorist.

Bulgarian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_verbs#Past_Aorist_Tense_.28Aoristus.29): Past aorist tense (Минало свършено време) expresses an action that happened at a specific time in the past. Both imperfective and perfective verbs have such tense (there is no difference in their conjugation). Although imperfective and perfective verbs are conjugated in the same way in the past aorist tense, there is difference in their meaning. Compare the sentences: //Вчера четох една книга// (aorist of imperfective verb) = "Yesterday, I read a book but I didn't finish it"; //Вчера прочетох една книга// (aorist of perfective verb) = "Yesterday, I finished reading a book/I read a whole book." The same meaning difference holds for the preterite of Czech imperfective and perfective verbs: //Včera jsem četl jednu knihu// vs. //Včera jsem přečetl jednu knihu.//

Example: aorist forms of the Bulgarian verb //чете// (to read):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //четох// | //четохме// |
| 2nd | //чете// | //четохте// |
| 3rd | //чете// | //четоха// |

DZ Interset decoding: ''tense = "past"; subtense = "aor";'' If we decide that aorist is the same tense as preterite we should handle them both the same way, i.e. ''tense = "past"; subtense = "";''.

Aorist has almost vanished from Czech. The only survivors are aorist forms of the auxiliary verb //být// (to be):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //bych// | //bychom// |
| 2nd | //bys// | //byste// |
| 3rd | //by// | //by// |

Since these forms are today used exclusively to construct analytic forms of **conditional**, they are decoded as conditional / subjunctive: ''mood = "sub"''.

===== Imperfect =====

Czech term: //souminulý čas//. Indicates that the action was taking place at the same time as some other action in past, similarly to the English construction //I was doing//. The English construction is analytic, made of past (preterite) of the auxiliary //to be//, and of present participle (gerund) of the main verb. However, there are languages with synthetic imperfect forms.

Portuguese example: //imperfeito// of //cantar// (to sing):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //cantava// | //cantávamos// |
| 2nd | //cantavas// | |
| 3rd | //cantava// | //cantavam// |

Spanish example: //imperfecto// of //cantar// (to sing):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //cantaba// | //cantabamos// |
| 2nd | //cantabas// | //cantábais// |
| 3rd | //cantaba// | //cantaban// |

Bulgarian (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_verbs#Past_Imperfect_Tense_.28Imperfectum.29): Past Imperfect Tense //(Минало несвършено време)// is used to talk about a temporary situation that existed at or around a particular time in the past. It also expresses past actions that were frequent, repeated, permanent or always true. Its most common use is in story telling to provide a background to other actions which are usually expressed with verbs in the past aorist. In this use it means that the action had begun and was in progress when the other action(s) happened, we don't know whether it stopped or not.

Both imperfective and perfective verbs have past imperfect tense. They are conjugated in the same way.

Verbs form the past imperfect tense with the following endings. Example: //чете// (to read):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //четях// | //четяхме// |
| 2nd | //четеше// | //четяхте// |
| 3rd | //четеше// | //четяха// |

DZ Interset decoding: ''tense = "past"; subtense = "imp";''

===== Perfect =====

Czech term: //předpřítomný čas//. A tense (not to be confused with perfective lexical aspect in some languages) indicating an action that took place in past but its relation to the present time point (result) is stressed (typically that the action has already / has not yet been completed). It is also called **present perfect,** as opposed to **past perfect (pluperfect)** and **future perfect.** In English, the exact time when the action took place is unknown, so e.g. the word //yesterday// cannot occur in a clause headed by perfect verb form.

Perfect is usually created analytically and thus there is no feature value denoting it. Typical formation is using present tense of an auxiliary and past participle (perfect participle) of the main verb.

DZ Interset decoding: auxiliary: ''tense = "pres"''; participle: ''verbform = "part"; (tense = "past")''

Example: present perfect of the English verb //to do//:

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //I have done// | //we have done// |
| 2nd | //you have done// | //you have done// |
| 3rd | //he has done// | //they have done// |

Example: present perfect of the German verb //machen// (to do):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //ich habe gemacht// | //wir haben gemacht// |
| 2nd | //du hast gemacht// | //ihr habt gemacht// |
| 3rd | //er hat gemacht// | //sie haben gemacht// |

Example: present perfect //(perfeito)// of the Portuguese verb //cantar// (to sing) is formed by present indicative of the auxiliary verb //ter// and the past participle //(participio)// of the main verb:

| Number | Singular | Plural |
| Person | | |
| 1st | //tenho cantado// | //temos cantado// |
| 2nd | //tens cantado// | |
| 3rd | //tem cantado// | //têm cantado// |

Example: present perfect (минало неопределено време, past indefinite tense) of the Bulgarian verb //чета// (to read) is formed by present indicative of the auxiliary verb //съм// (to be) and by past active aorist participle of the main verb:

| Number | Singular | | | Plural |
| Gender | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | |
| Person | | | | |
| 1st | //чел съм// | //чела съм// | //чело съм// | //чели сме// |
| 2nd | //чел си// | //чела си// | //чело си// | //чели сте// |
| 3rd | //чел е// | //чела е// | //чело е// | //чели са// |

===== Pluperfect =====

Czech term: //předminulý čas//. A tense indicating an action that took place in past and has been completed before another action in past. It is also called **past perfect,** as opposed to **(present) perfect** and **future perfect.**

Pluperfect is usually created analytically; however, see Portuguese synthetic pluperfect below. Typical formation is using past (preterite) tense of an auxiliary and past participle (perfect participle) of the main verb.

Example: past perfect of the English verb //to do//:

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //I had done// | //we had done// |
| 2nd | //you had done// | //you had done// |
| 3rd | //he had done// | //they had done// |

Example: past perfect (Plusquamperfekt) of the German verb //machen// (to do):

| Person | Number |
| | Singular | Plural |
| 1st | //ich hatte gemacht// | //wir hatten gemacht// |
| 2nd | //du hattest gemacht// | //ihr hattet gemacht// |
| 3rd | //er hatte gemacht// | //sie hatten gemacht// |

Portuguese pluperfect //(mais-que-perfeito)// has both synthetic and analytic forms. The analytic forms are constructed similarly to Germanic languages, from past //(imperfeito)// tense of the auxiliary verb //ter// and the past participle //(participio)// of the main verb. Note that the synthetic forms are parallel to Spanish forms that are called //subjunctivo imperfecto (spojovací způsob souminulý)//. Portuguese also knows //subjuntivo imperfeito// but its forms are neither homonymous, nor similar to the synthetic pluperfect. Spanish has the analytic pluperfect forms //(pretérito pluscuamperfecto).//

| Number | Singular | Plural |
| Person | | |
| 1st | //tinha cantado// | //tínhamos cantado// |
| | //cantara// | //cantáramos// |
| 2nd | //tinhas cantado// | |
| | //cantaras// | |
| 3rd | //tinha cantado// | //tinham cantado// |
| | //cantara// | //cantaram// |

Example: past perfect (минало предварително време, past preliminary tense) of the Bulgarian verb //чета// (to read) is formed by past aorist indicative of the auxiliary verb //съм// (to be) and by past active aorist participle of the main verb:

| Number | Singular | | | Plural |
| Gender | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | |
| Person | | | | |
| 1st | //бях чел// | //бях чела// | //бях чело// | //бяхме чели// |
| 2nd | //бе(ше) чел// | //бе(ше) чела// | //бе(ше) чело// | //бяхте чели// |
| 3rd | //бе(ше) чел// | //бе(ше) чела// | //бе(ше) чело// | //бяха чели// |

DZ Interset decoding of the analytic forms: auxiliary: ''tense = "past"''; participle: ''verbform = "part"; (tense = "past")''. Decoding of the synthetic forms in Portuguese: ''tense = "past"; subtense = "pqp";''.

===== Preterite anterior =====

Spanish: //pretérito anterior.// Spanish bookish pluperfect forms that are used in tandem with the simple perfect forms (while normal pluperfect is used to compare time with imperfect past action). In colloquial language only normal pluperfect is used. //Pretérito anterior// (Czech //předminulý čas dokonavý//) is formed analytically by simple perfect forms of the auxiliary verb //haber// and the participle of the main verb: //hube hablado, hubiste hablado...//

Participle in compound verb tenses has only one form //(ella ha cantado)//, in contrast to adjectival use where gender and number is distinguished //(casado hombre, casada mujer, casados hombres, casadas mujeres)//. Gerund //(gerundio)// has only one form //(ella está cantando)//.

===== Conditional =====

Grammars of some languages regard conditional as a tense, although others treat it as a mood. Czech: //podmiňovací způsob// (conditional mood). In English and other languages the present conditional can indicate future relative to some point in the past: //I warned him that I would call the Police if he did not turn down the music.// Often constructed analytically, in which case there is no need to use ''mood = "cond"''.

Czech: present conditional mood is constructed by aorist form of the auxiliary verb //být// (to be) and the active past participle of the main verb. Past conditional mood is constructed from the present conditional of the auxiliary verb //být// and the active past participle of the main verb.

| | Number | Singular | | | Plural | | |
| | Gender | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| Person | Tense | | | | | | |
| 1st | Present | //četl bych// | //četla bych// | //četlo bych// | //četli bychom// | //četly bychom// | //četla bychom// |
| | Past | //byl bych četl// | //byla bych četla// | //bylo bych četlo// | //byli bychom četli// | //byly bychom četly// | //byla bychom četla// |
| 2nd | Present | //četl bys// | //četla bys// | //četlo bys// | //četli byste// | //četly byste// | //četla byste// |
| | Past | //byl bys četl// | //byla bys četla// | //bylo bys četlo// | //byli byste četli// | //byly byste četly// | //byla byste četla// |
| 3rd | Present | //četl by// | //četla by// | //četlo by// | //četli by// | //četly by// | //četla by// |
| | Past | //byl by četl// | //byla by četla// | //bylo by četlo// | //byli by četli// | //byly by četly// | //byla by četla// |

English: conditional is made of //would// (past tense of the auxiliary verb //will//) and of base form of the main verb. Past conditional is made similarly but instead of the present indicative, there is the compound present perfect form of the main verb. Example: verb //to sing//.

| | Number | Singular | Plural |
| Person | Tense | | |
| 1st | Present | //I would sing// | //we would sing// |
| | Past | //I would have sung// | //we would have sung// |
| 2nd | Present | //you would sing// | //you would sing// |
| | Past | //you would have sung// | //you would have sung// |
| 3rd | Present | //he would sing// | //they would sing// |
| | Past | //he would have sung// | //they would have sung// |

German: conditional //(Konditional)// is made of past subjunctive //(Konjunktiv Präteritum)// form of the auxiliary verb //werden//, and the infinitive of the main verb.

| | Number | Singular | Plural |
| Person | Tense | | |
| 1st | Present | //ich würde singen// | //wir würden singen// |
| | Past | //ich würde gesungen haben// | //wir würden gesungen haben// |
| 2nd | Present | //du würdest singen// | //ihr würdet singen// |
| | Past | //du würdest gesungen haben// | //ihr würdet gesungen haben// |
| 3rd | Present | //er würde singen// | //sie würden singen// |
| | Past | //er würde gesungen haben// | //sie würden gesungen haben// |

Portuguese: present conditional //(condicional)// has synthetic forms and past (perfect) conditional is analytic, made of present conditional of the auxiliary verb //ter//, and of the participle of the main verb.

| | Number | Singular | Plural |
| Person | Tense | | |
| 1st | Present | //cantaria// | //cantaríamos// |
| | Past | //teria cantado// | //teríamos cantado// |
| 2nd | Present | //cantarias// | |
| | Past | //terias cantado// | |
| 3rd | Present | //cantaria// | //cantariam// |
| | Past | //teria cantado// | //teriam cantado// |

The synthetic present forms require that the decoder set ''mood = "cond"''.



===== Subjunctive =====

In grammars of some languages called //conjunctive//. Czech: //spojovací způsob//. In some languages its usage overlaps with **conditional** (German //Konjunktiv//: //Hätte er heute kommen wollen, würde ich nicht abreisen.// = "If he wanted to come today I would not travel away." Spanish //subjuntivo// is used in subordinated clauses after a subordinating conjunction like in //que hable// = //that I speak// = (Czech) //ať mluvím//, //abych mluvil//. It also works as a sort of **imperative** in persons that do not have their own imperative forms (1st and 3rd).

German has synthetic forms called //Konjunktiv I// (present) and //Konjunktiv II// (past, preterite). There is a significant overlap of forms of present subjunctive with present indicative.

| | Number | Singular | Plural |
| Person | Tense | | |
| 1st | Present | //ich singe// | //wir singen// |
| | Past | //ich sänge// | //wir sängen// |
| 2nd | Present | //du singest// | //ihr singet// |
| | Past | //du sängest// | //ihr sänget// |
| 3rd | Present | //er singe// | //sie singen// |
| | Past | //er sänge// | //sie sängen// |

Portuguese forms subjunctive //(subjuntivo)// of 6 tenses, 3 of that synthetic.

| | Number | Singular | Plural |
| Person | Tense | | |
| 1st | Present | //cante// | //cantemos// |
| | Imperfect | //cantasse// | //cantássemos// |
| | Future | //cantar// | //cantarmos// |
| 2nd | Present | //cantes// | |
| | Imperfect | //cantasses// | |
| | Future | //cantares// | |
| 3rd | Present | //cante// | //cantem// |
| | Imperfect | //cantasse// | //cantassem// |
| | Future | //cantar// | //cantarem// |

DZ Interset decoding: ''mood = "sub"''
