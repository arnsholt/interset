====== Tag Set Drivers ======

This is an overview of existing tag set drivers. Tag-set or language specific issues are described here. I also try to keep track of the work time needed for particular drivers because the original motivation behind DZ Interset was to save time and effort.

===== Arabic (ar) =====

The Arabic CoNLL tags are derived from the tags of the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank.

Created in 2006-2007.
Total work time: 13 hours

===== Bulgarian (bg) =====

The Bulgarian CoNLL tags are derived from the tags of BulTreeBank. Speciality: sophisticated system of pronouns includes interrogative adverbs and numerals.

Created in 2007.
Total work time: 35 hours

The main reasons why the implementation took so long:
  * Necessity to re-work the system of main word classes, especially pronouns.
  * Necessity to separate morphological and lexical definiteness (there are indefinite pronouns morphologically definite, and vice versa).
  * Necessity to separate morphological and lexical aspect (aorist vs. imperfect tense; there are perfective verbs that can occur in imperfect tense).
  * Driver tester required that encode(decode(x))=x. However, the CoNLL incarnation of the tags was inconsistent, in the order and form in which it presented features.

===== Chinese (zh) =====

The only corpus covered so far is the Sinica Treebank, converted to the CoNLL format. The tag set lacks comprehensive documentation (almost zero supplied with CoNLL data, and only a little found in the web). The tags do not encode any morphological features. Instead, there is a comprehensive (but undocumented) hierarchy of word classes and subclasses. Most of the information encoded in the tags cannot be mapped to Interset.

Pronouns are special cases of nouns. Numerals are special cases of determiners.

There are many sorts of particles, some of which have special tags (DE).

Work finished: 5.3.2008
Total work time: 21:30 h

Most of the time was dedicated to extracting, transcribing and translating examples in an effort to understand the tag classes.

===== Czech (cs) =====

==== Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) ====

Při práci na tomto ovladači jsem ještě neměl k dispozici chytré funkce pro zajištění povolených značek.

Jde zatím o nejrozsáhlejší sadu značek, se kterou jsem se setkal. Obsahuje 4288 značek.

České značky PDT (přes 4000 značek; jádro Intersetu vzniklo jako vedlejší produkt, když jsem dělal tohle) asi 2 dny, tedy dejme tomu 18 hodin. Dalších 11:09 hodin jsem spotřeboval, když jsem začal ovladače testovat a musel jsem tenhle opravovat. Opět platí, že část času zabralo ladění testovacího skriptu, který v té době teprve vznikal.

==== CoNLL 2006 ====

The CoNLL 2006 and 2007 Czech treebanks are data from PDT converted to the CoNLL format. The PDT morphological tags have been decomposed into coarse-grained part of speech, detailed part of speech, and a set of feature values. All PDT tags have unique equivalents in CoNLL. However, the mapping to the original PDT tags is not one-to-one. Some information, encoded in lemmas in the PDT, has been encoded as a new feature called ''Sem'' in CoNLL data. README refers the following documentation: [[http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt/Corpora/PDT_1.0/References/mman.html#pos-tag|part of speech and most features]] | [[http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt/Corpora/PDT_1.0/References/mman.html#sem-info|lemma features]]

The list of tags of this tagset contains equivalents of all original PDT tags. In addition, it contains those tags with the ''Sem'' feature set, that occur in CoNLL data, and a few more. The ''Sem'' values are currently stored in the ''other'' feature of Interset. At the same time, ''subpos = "prop"'' is set if ''Sem'' is set and ''subpos'' would otherwise be empty. (The original PDT tags cannot distinguish proper from common nouns.) If the encoder encounters ''subpos = "prop"'', it uses the default value "Sem=m". The "few more" tags were added to the list whenever there was a tag ''Foo=bar|Sem=something'' and there was not the default ''Foo=bar|Sem=m''.

Work started: 25.3.2008
Work finished: 25.3.2008
Total work time: 6:02 h

More than half of the time was consumed during testing for tuning tags containing the Sem feature.

==== CoNLL 2009 ====

The [[:format-conll|CoNLL data format]] has changed. Formerly (2006 and 2007) there were three relevant columns (coarse-grained part of speech, fine-grained part of speech, and features) that we combined (using tabs) into one tag string. As of 2009, there are only two columns left, namely part of speech and features. For the Czech tags this further means that there is a new feature in the 'features' column. It is called ''SubPOS'', it is present in all tags and its value is one character, copied from the second position of the standard PDT tag. Otherwise, the tags should be identical to those of CoNLL 2007, including the ''Sem'' feature.

The ''Sem'' feature can have more values than previously. This is caused by the extension of the [[http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~zeman/publikace/2005-01/mmanual.html#lemma-term|term value set]] in the Prague Dependency Treebank 2.0 (in contrast to 1.0), so the change actually applied already to CoNLL 2007 data. However, CoNLL 2007 uses the older ''cs::conll'' driver.

Work started: 24.3.2009
Work finished: 24.3.2009
Total work time: 1:10 h

==== Multext ====

The tagset of the MULTEXT-EAST project and corpora. The file ''mte-lex/wfl-cs.tbl'' contains 1428 unique tags (which is not to say that other tags are not possible). The corpora are stored in a TEI-compliant SGML format. It is easily readable except that non-ASCII characters are encoded using SGML entities.

Work started: 16.2.2009
Work finished: 18.2.2009
Total work time: 16:36 h

Czech tagsets are notoriously complex. This one maps quite nicely to DZ Interset features. However, the few distinctions that are not (yet) represented in DZ Interset made debugging difficult. Clitic_s and generic numerals represented using the ''other'' feature led to wrong feature-value combinations in conversions to/from other Czech sets. DZ Interset had to be slightly modified in response to this tagset, and more changes that initiated here will be done later.

===== Danish (da) =====

Tags of the Danish Dependency Treebank converted to CoNLL format. 144 tags with complex documentation in Danish.

Total work time: about 7 hours

===== English (en) =====

==== Penn Treebank Tagset ====

Penn Treebank (45 atomic tags). Detailed classification of punctuation.

Total work time: about 3 hours

==== CoNLL 2006 ====

The driver is just an envelope around the ''en::penn'' driver.

Total work time: 48 minutes

==== CoNLL 2009 ====

Another envelope around the ''en::penn'' driver. However, three new tags required changes even in the older drivers: ''HYPH'', ''AFX'' (''PRF'') and ''NIL''.

Work started: 25.3.2009
Work finished: 25.3.2009
Total work time: 2:57 h

===== German (de) =====

==== Stuttgart-Tübingen Tagset (STTS) ====

This is the tagset used in the Tiger treebank. It is quite syntax-oriented, often the same word can be tagged in couple different ways according to its function in a particular sentence. Pronouns are systematically categorized as substitutive (occur instead of an NP), attributive (occur inside an NP) and adverbial.

The tags omit inflectional information (number and case of pronouns and articles, degree of comparison of adjectives, tense (Präteritum, Konjunktiv), person and number of verbs).

Work started: 29.3.2008
Work finished: 29.3.2008
Total work time: 4:00 h

==== CoNLL (derived from STTS) ====

Only simple envelope around the STTS driver needed.

Work started: 31.3.2008
Work finished: 31.3.2008
Total work time: 10 min

===== Portuguese (pt) =====

The Portuguese CoNLL treebank contains tags with 149 different features. Big part of them are noise, probably introduced by the conversion procedure from the original Floresta format to the CoNLL format. The driver is designed so that it accepts all incorrect tags on decoding but encodes only corrected tags. Incorrect tags are not on the list of possible tags so the driver tester will not complain.

Work started: 2.4.2008
Work finished: 24.4.2008
Total work time: 28:18 h

The CoNLL version of the Floresta tagset was a real pain. Not only is the tagset complex with many features, some of them strangely overlapping, some of them undocumented. There was also a terrible proportion of noise, typos or otherwise introduced errors in annotation.

===== Swedish (sv) =====

==== Mamba and CoNLL ====

Mamba tagset of Talbanken05. 48 tags, no morphosyntactic categories but detailed classification of auxiliary and modal verbs and punctuation. CoNLL driver is just an envelope around Mamba.

Total work time: about 3 hours

==== Tags of Hajič's Swedish tagger ====

Based on PAROLE Swedish tagset but some characters different (@ => W), and filled by dashes to uniform length of 9 characters (although i-th position does not always encode the same feature).

No reliable statistics of work time; estimated 8 hours

===== Time needed for tag set conversion =====

Some records about targeted tagset conversion for given tagset pairs, done in early 2006:

Ruský treebank (nejen značky, ale vůbec převod formátu):
12:36

Arabské značky (Otovy i Buckwalterovy, ještě bez Intersetu, 22.3.2006):
4:45+1+1:40 = 7:25
