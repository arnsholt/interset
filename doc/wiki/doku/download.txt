===== Please consider registering =====

DZ Interset is a result of my research and my research is funded by public money. Of course I have to report to the funding agencies and I want to be able to demonstrate that other people use my software. So registering is not mandatory but I ask you to do it anyway.

Do not worry, I **will not** give away your e-mail, neither to the funding agencies, nor to anyone else. I do not even need your e-mail address (but I am ready to take it in case you wish to be informed about major future changes to DZ Interset).

**The latest release, packed using ''zip'', is available [[http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~zeman/soubory/interset-v1.1.zip|here]].**

The DZ Interset project uses the [[http://trac.edgewall.org/|Trac]] web interface for project management. It provides access (via //Browse Source//) to the subversion repository of various revisions of the code. The structure is more fine-grained (not all revisions constitute new releases) and diffs between revisions are available. The Trac server requires authentication, so anonymous read-only access is currently not available. For authorized users, the entry point is [[http://svn.ms.mff.cuni.cz/projects/interset|here]].
